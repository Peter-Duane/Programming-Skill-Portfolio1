word1="Coding " #put the first word as the first variable
word2="is " #then put the second word as the second variable
word3="Cool" #lastly, put the last word as the last variable

print(word1 + word2 + word3) #the (+) operator will add up every variable in the program, 
#however with strings, the result should be that the words will be right next to each other accordingly.
